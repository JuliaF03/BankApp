# BankApp

Its just a little project to keep things going 

I've never used data tables together with Python and so far is being interesting, also its a great opportunity to remember SQL haha

The plan is to develop some kind of bank situation, first obviously with basic stuff like savings, balance, and transactions. I want to focus not only on these financial things, but on the configuration/user side as well, so I want to provide an experience similar to what we are used to, like creating accounts, login, etc.
